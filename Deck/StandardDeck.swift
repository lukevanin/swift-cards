/// "The most common type of playing card is that found in the French-suited, standard 52-card pack"
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card
///
///  There are four suites in a deck of playing cards. The suites are (in alphabetical order):
/// - Clubs ‚ô£Ô∏è
/// - Diamonds ‚ô¶Ô∏è
/// - Hearts ‚ô•Ô∏è
/// - Spades ‚ô†Ô∏è
///
/// Each suite is one of two colors, being either red or black.
///
/// There are thirteen cards in each suite. The cards are:
/// - King
/// - Queen
/// - Jack
/// - Ten
/// - Nine
/// - Eight
/// - Seven
/// - Six
/// - Five
/// - Four
/// - Three
/// - Two
/// - Ace
///
/// The deck has a total of fifty two cards, where there is one card for each combination of rank and suite.
///
/// Cards usually have some semantic value depending on the rules of the game being played. Cards might
/// be compared by their relative face value (e.g. King vs Seven), suite (e.g. Hearts vs Diamonds), or
/// color (e.g. Red vs Black).
